This plugin is a port of Instant.js (polaroid style images - http://www.netzgesta.de/instant/).. to wordpress.

== Description ==

With this port of the Javascript "instant" who whas made by Christian Effenber (http://gernetzgesta.de):

- instant.js version 1.5:
     Image Effect: Simulates an instant picture look including tilt! The script allows you to add individual colors, tiltings and shadows to images on your webpages. Requires no plugin/extension or any other external resource!
    * New since 1.5: Added support to preserve image aspect ratio
    It uses unobtrusive javascript to keep your code clean and works in all the major browsers - Mozilla Firefox 1.5+, Opera 9+, IE6+ and Safari. On older browsers, it'll degrade and your visitors won't notice a thing.
    For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.


- Php side of this plugin:
    * NEW Parse every images who whas posted to add class="xxx" to the image, you don't need to add it manualy to the pics,
    Insert the "<script type='text/javascript' src='thePathOfPlugin/instant.js'></script>" to your blog,
    No admin page, at this time...
